Release 1.1.2

With the release of cf-puppeteer 1.1.2 we worked on backporting some v3 features to the `legacy-push` option.
We also implemented the possibility to use all features with docker images.

All new features and bugfixes are listed below.

New Legacy-push options:

```bash
--route-only
--no-route
``` 

New v3 options:
```bash
--docker-image
--docker-username
```

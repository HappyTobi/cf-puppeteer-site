Release 1.1.1

With the release of cf-puppeteer with version 1.1.1 we worked on some feedback of the community and make the usability easier and more user friendly

All new features and bugfixes are listed below.

```bash
--no-route
--venerable-action
``` 

---

## Examples

### No-routes
Deploy the application without route switching - old application should still run and new one should be stoped after deployment.
(Venerable-action will be set to none automatically )

```bash
cf zero-downtime-push -f ./manifest.yml --no-routes 
```

now you can add new services or what ever you want.
To start the new application with routes and cleanup the old one you can do the following things:

```bash
cf zero-downtime-push -f ./manifest.yml --routes-only
```

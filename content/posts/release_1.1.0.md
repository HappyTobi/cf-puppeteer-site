Release 1.1.0

With the release of cf-puppeteer version 1.1.0 we bring some new features and bugfixes.

The new features and bugfixes are listed below.

```bash
--no-route
--route-only
``` 

---

## Examples

### No-routes
Deploy the application without route switching - old application should still run and new one should be stoped after deployment

```bash
cf zero-downtime-push -f ./manifest.yml --no-route --vendor-option none
```

right now you can add new services or what ever you want.
To start the new application with routes and cleanup the old one you can do the following things:

```bash
cf zero-downtime-push -f ./manifest.yml --routes-only
```
